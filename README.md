## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer. I primarily develop with TypeScript, React, Nest.js, and MySQL. 

## Bio

I started out with Java as my first language. During my free time in college, I would casually learn Node.js & Web Development technologies. My first project was a simple Discord Bot, which allowed me to familiarize myself more with JavaScript & Node.js. As time went by, I found myself diving deeper into technologies I had never even heard of. My second successful project was a simple unofficial web application I built that tracks laundry machine status for UAlbany, which then turned into a progressive web app built with Ionic & Angular, that was also deployed on the Google Play store. Several projects I have worked on include a Full Stack app for a local towing business, Code Ring, a platform built using GitHub's API & Webhook Data to create competitive open-source coding events, Flutter app for an in-house hackathon for my company, and Dogwrench, a project that is in the works and yet to be released.
